/*
  This last example details how to receive and decode a reply from the server.
  
  It can be used to fetch the time from the server or to get any data from the server.
  It could form the basis for an internet activated lighting or even a heating system.
  where the basestation polls the server periodically asking if the user has requested
  a light to be on etc.
  
  As in the BasicWebClient example we send a request using:
  ether.browseUrl(PSTR("/time/local.json?apikey=YOURAPIKEY"),"", website, my_callback);
  
  But notice the my_callback bit - this is the name of the function to be called when a reply is received
  
  In the my_callback function we get the data part of the reply and put it in the line_buf char array buffer.
  We then go through the line_buf char array and decode it as needed. (see comments below)
